#### DEAR USERS OF THE INTERNET,

In January 2012 we defeated the SOPA and PIPA censorship legislation with the largest Internet protest in history. Today we face another critical threat, one that again undermines the Internet and the notion that any of us live in a genuinely free society: mass surveillance.

In celebration of the win against SOPA and PIPA two years ago, and in memory of one of it's leaders, [Aaron Swartz](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/12/aaron-swartz-heroism-suicide1), we are planning a day of protest against mass surveillance, to take place this **February 11th, 2014**.

Together we will push back against powers that seek to observe, collect, and analyze our every digital action. Together, we will make it clear that such behavior is not compatible with democratic governance. Together, if we persist, we will win this fight.


#### WHAT WE'LL DO ON FEBRUARY 11th, 2014:

**If you're in the US:** Thousands of websites will host banners urging people to call/email Congress. We'll ask legislators to oppose the [FISA Improvements Act](https://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security-technology-and-liberty/sen-dianne-feinsteins-nsa-reforms-bad-privacy-bad), support the [USA Freedom Act](https://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/usa-freedom-act-real-spying-reform), and enact protections for non-Americans.

**If you're not in the US:** Visitors will be asked to urge appropriate targets to institute privacy protections.
