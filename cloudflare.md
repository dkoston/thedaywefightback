This app lets you automatically add The Day We Fight Back banner to your site on February 11th, 2014. The Day We Fight Back is an organization that has organized a protest against mass surveillance. The banner that your visitors would see urges them to reach out to members of the US Congress to oppose the [FISA Improvements Act](https://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security-technology-and-liberty/sen-dianne-feinsteins-nsa-reforms-bad-privacy-bad), support the [USA Freedom Act](https://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/usa-freedom-act-real-spying-reform) or sign a petition if outside the US.

When web visitors see your banner, they can take 1 of 2 actions. They can call their US member of Congress or send an email, using a sample script provided by the Day We Fight Back. Visitors outside of the US can still participate - they can sign a petition organized by the country they select.

Other organizations such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Mozilla and others have joined this effort to express their concern that mass surveillance has on the freedom and openness of the internet.
